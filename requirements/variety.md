    - The ship should have different weapons, speed, durability, and other attributes that affect gameplay.
    - The ship should be visually distinct from the original ship to avoid confusion.

2. **Design 3 new enemies. These enemies will have unique characteristics such as their size, movement patterns, attacks, and durability.**

    - The enemies should have different sizes and/or durability to create a diverse set of challenges for the player.
    - The enemies should be visually distinct from each other to avoid confusion.

3. **Allow switching between the different playable ships at the beginning of the game**
   - The player should be able to choose from the available ships before starting the game.
   - The ship selection should be implemented in the main menu or settings menu.

4. **Implement "special enemies." These elite enemies will be similar to their normal versions, but they can have a specific attribute enhanced such as their speed or attack.**
    - The special enemies should be visually distinct from the normal enemies to indicate their enhanced attributes.
